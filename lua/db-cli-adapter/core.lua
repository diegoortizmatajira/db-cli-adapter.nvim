--- connections if they are available, avoiding a re-fetch from the source files.

--- JSON-encoded connection data. The function reads these files, decodes the
--- JSON data, and constructs a table of connections. Connections are identified
--- by their name and the source they come from.
---
--- If the source file or path is invalid or unreadable, it will be skipped.
---
--- @param cache_only boolean|nil If true, only return cached connections instead of re-fetching.
--- @return table A table of available connections, where the keys are connection names
---   (formatted as "name (from source_key)") and the values are the connection details.
